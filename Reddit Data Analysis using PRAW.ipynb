    "Assume you are new to the data science field, and you want to find out what real practitioners and soon-to-be data scientists are concerned about. One place where you may find such information is X (formerly known as Twitter). However, X users often use their real identities and may have reservations about sharing all their opinions publicly. Another place where such information maybe found is the datascience subreddit on Reddit.com (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/). Users are assumed to be anonymous and they are more likely to share their opinions without reservations. To find out common concerns among the datascience subreddit users, it might be a good idea to collect the top 100 posts in the subreddit in the year 2023. You might also collect the top 3 comments of each of those posts. In this case study, we will do exactly that. Specific details can be found in the next few cells. \n",
